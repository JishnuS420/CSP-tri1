        <h1 id="dopamine">Dopamine</h1>
        <p>Dopamine plays a crucial role in how we feel pleasure and motivation. It’s what drives us to pursue things that make us happy, whether it’s food, chatting with friends, or being rewarded. But with social media and stuff, people are becoming detoxed to this sensation. This results in the attention span of people being greatly reduced and them being more likely to be distracted since they want to feel the dopamine rush. This is a huge problem since it leads to stuff like procrastinating and this leads to and unhealthy and harmful lifestyle. And so, people shouldn’t just treat it like it’s a hoax but actually think of it as a greater problem.</p>

    <h1 id="52-reflection">5.2 Reflection</h1>
    <p>In a largely digital world like ours, a digital divide would mean that and unequal access to technology and knowledge would be present. This would affect things like jobs oppurtunities and education, causing a higher level of disparity between people with access and those without. Also with a large majority of mass communication and just normal day to day communication being done digitally, people would be unable to particpate in society equally, leading to some opinions not being heard and would result in a large bias.</p>
