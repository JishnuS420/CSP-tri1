    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for **binary digit**, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called **abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "3 * 8 = 24 bits \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "\n",
    "Any digital information can be represented as long as it is encoded in the binary form.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bits are digital data what this means is that that its only got two states 1 or 0 however analog can be a wide range of values or example, something like the the arrow keys on a controller would be digital but something like a joystick on the controller would be more like an analog type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
    "    - 1 = True\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in **overflow** or other errors.\n",
    "* Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory.\n",

    "\n",
    "2^n-1 = (2^5) - 1 = 31\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One programming language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language?\n",
    "\n",
    "2^50/2^16 = 2^40 is the amount of unique numbers that can be represented by the second language \n",
    "\n",
    "3. 5 bits are used to represent both positive and negative numbers, what is the largest number that can be represented by these bits? (*hint: different than question 1*)\n",
    "\n",
    "1 bit is used to represent positive or negative so \n",

    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Binary is Base 2, meaning each digit can only represent values of 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Decimal is Base 10, meaning eacht digit can represent values from 0 to 9.\n",
    "* Conversion between sequences of binary to decimal depend on how many binary numbers there are, their values and their positions.\n",

    "\n",
    "They can represent 0, 1, 2, 3, and/or 4\n",

    "\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",

    "    4. 63\n",
    "* **Fill in the blanks** (convert to decimal) \n",
    "    1. 001010 = 2 + 8 = 10\n",
    "    2. 11100010 = 2 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 226\n",
