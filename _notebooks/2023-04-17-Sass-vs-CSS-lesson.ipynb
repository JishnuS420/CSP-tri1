    "> #### CSS is the default language that most programmers use to style a webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user.  "

What this allows us to do is it enables us to things like nested styling, functions, mixins, variables, inheritance (more on these later) and so on. "

SCSS on the other hand is very good for more complex styling and working with a project with more than one page where maybe lots of customization is needed. "
