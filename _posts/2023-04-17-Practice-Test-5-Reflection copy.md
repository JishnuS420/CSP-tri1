# Final Score 
My final score was 64/66 but I believe that it should be much lower since before submitting I checked it over with some friends

# Question 42:

I got this question wrong because I forgot that binary is always 2^n but i just did 1*n which gave me 98, in the future, i need to remember that binary counts as 2 not 1

# Question 45:

This question was a little bit confusing and I didn't really understand how to do it, the way you do this question is through input different values to make the situation realistic. The right answer here is C since when both P and Q are true, it does result in false.
