# Algorithmic Efficency and Heuristic:

- Problem: a general description of a task that can or cannot be solved algorithmically
- Decision Problem: A problem with a yes or no answer
- Organization Problem: a problem with a goal of finding the best answer
- Instance: a problem with a specific input
- Efficiency: amount of computing needed to solve a problem
- Polynomial Efficiency (Good): more work takes a proportional amount of time (1 job is +2 time)
- Exponential Efficiency (Bad): more work takes an exponential amount more time (1 job is 2x time)
- Heuristic Approach: When optimal solutions are inefficient, look for a possibly optimal solution that is more efficient
- Decidable Problem: A decision problem that has a clear solution that will always make a correct output
- Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution that is not guaranteed to produce the correct output
- Heuristic solutions are when we sacrifice optimal solutions to improve efficiency and ease of programming
- Used when normal methods would take forever. 

# Lesson Plan: 

Me and Max work on Algorithmic Efficiency and Alan and Evan work on the Undecidable problems. Max goes through the main topic and big O notation based on his notes on Khan Academy and College board. I use the college board example, to explain what is happening. We will establish a purpose and go about the lesson building surrounding that purpose.
