# Final Test Score:

# Not Question Related Reflection:
- First off, I felt that I took way too much time on the test, I spent 2-3 hours working on it, something right off the bat that I can improve on is my speed.
- In order to improve on this, one thing that I can do is limit myself to a certain amount of time and keep reducing everytime, helping me speed up.
- Another thing I could work on is doing the test in one sitting, I did the test over a span of multiple days and this isn't a good representation of the situation in the APCSP AP Exam.
