# Planning the Code

First thing first, I had to decide what I wanted to create on the AppLab, some ideas that I came up with involved:
- A game
- A Quiz on a topic im interested in
- Maybe a calculator

I decided to go with the Quiz idea since its something that I felt that I use to further personalize myself and my blog

What I want the user to go through:
- A starting prompt
- A multiple choice question with a correct and wrong answer screen 
- A free response question 
- User has to start from the very start if they get it wrong 
- Pain lol

## Problems that I came across while coding:
- Sometimes, there were too many options for ids and I would struggle to find the right one
- The code was sometimes hard to locate where they were and the images took a while to get because they often weren't supported by the app lab
- When changing/renaming a id, it doesn't change it universally so I had to go through and rename multiple ids 

### Final Product

I decided to focus on one of my all time favorite shows and movie series, Star Wars, and made a little trivia on it with some tricky questions and overall, I would say that I am pretty satisfied with the results and although, there were somethings that I certainly could have done better, overall, it was a good learning experience

### Changes that can be implemented
 
There are some changes and improvements that could take place, for example, it would be significantly better if I could loop some of the codes because it got really repetitive at a point and another thing that would make my life easier would be if I was more organized, maybe better planned a bit and it would have made coding the quiz much more easier, next time, I would also love to experiment with making a game instead of a quiz
