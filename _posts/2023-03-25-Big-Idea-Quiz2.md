# Final Score
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bigidea2quizscore.png)

This quiz wasn't particularly hard and was pretty easy, the questions were easy and the wording all made sense and the test didn't take much time, one of the things that really helped were the previous quizzes since some of the questions were repeated so I already knew the answers to some of them

# Question 1:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bigidea2correction.png)

This question was really easy, what I messed up on was forgetting to do subtract 1 since I like to do bianry with my fingers, I forgot that I need to counting the fingers from 0 and not 1 but I counted from 1 to 8 instead of 0 to 8

# Tips for the Future

For the future, some tips that I have for myself is to take my time and not rush the questions as well as do as many questions as possible so that I can save lots of time if a question was repeated on the AP test
