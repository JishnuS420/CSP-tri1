## Question 22
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCFinal2-3.png)
For this question, I hate the robot questions, they are definetly the ones that give me the hardest time but what I did wrong here is that I was rushing this question and forgot about the if/else statement didn't apply the else statement to the 1st grid and that the robot would've gone through perfectly
## Question 33
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCFinal2-4.png)
For this question, although I didn't get it wrong, I spent a lot more time than I should've on this question because I got confused, in the future, I should just take these problems slowly
## Question 43
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/MCFinal2-2.png)
For this question what I did wrong was that I rushed the question and I ended up selecting the wrong answer by accident since I thought I changed the answer but I guess not. Next time, I should double check that i selected the right answer.
