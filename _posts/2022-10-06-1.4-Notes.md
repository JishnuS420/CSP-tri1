# Video 1 Notes:
- 4 Types of Errors: Logic (Caused by the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm which causes the program to behave unexpectedly), Syntax (a typo or writes some code or forgets to write code, doesn't follow language), Run-Time Error (Program fails while running mostly due to a bug so cannot run code entirely), Overflow Error (Memory Allocation constraint prevents calculations from taking place)
# Video 2 Notes:
- Syntax Error is easiest to identify
- Error helps identify and correct an error
- Logic Errors hard to find; Using test cases can help find these errors easier
- Handtracing is another method to help in smaller segements of code that iterates
- Visualizations with graphs, tables, color and more can help identify errors
- Debuggers can help test for any errors that may exist
