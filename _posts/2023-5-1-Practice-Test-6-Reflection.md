# Final Score 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image1.png)

My final score was 63/67

# Question 24: 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image2.png)

This question was simple but I failed to recognize that that the starting value was 0 and not 1 so all the answers should've been even but I didn't do that and so got this question wrong.

# Question 15:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image3.png)

This question, what happened was I choose an option that was close to the answer, I failed to recognize teh small difference in between the answers thus why I got this question wrong.

# Question 33:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image4.png)

This question I happened to get wrong because I thought that since we aren't given the number of students, we can't relate it to a proportionality and so I went with D but the answer is A because the conditions of the data only show the average not the actual assignment scores 

# Question 66L

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image5.png)

This question I got wrong because I had the wrong interpretation of the code, hence why I got the question wrong, I choose options that are similar to the actual answer so at least I have some idea of what I am doing.
